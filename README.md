### 🧑‍💻 About Me:  
🌱 **Currently Growing:** AI systems, Transformers, and Data Science wizardry.  
🎨 **Secret Talent:** Turning boring data into mesmerizing dashboards.  
🎯 **Mission:** Empowering decision-making with actionable insights.  

When I’m not training machine learning models or analyzing trends, you’ll find me experimenting with **AI for social good**, cracking jokes with pandas (the library, not the animal 🐼), or tuning hyperparameters for life.

### 🤖 **Programmer Analyst** @ Cognizant Technology Solutions (2020 - 2022):  
- Automated boring tasks and became the office superhero (VBA Macros + Python = 🦸).  
- Built a Power BI dashboard that reduced report time by 15% and earned an “overtime hero” badge.  
- Tuned an XGBoost model so sharp it could cut through inaccuracies.

## 🚀 **Projects I’m Proud Of:**  
- **Altriva**: RAG chatbot for alternative medicine. LLAMA + Transformers-powered assistant.  
- **Brain Tumor Classification**: AI + TensorFlow = 94% MRI accuracy! (No brain cells harmed).  
- **Financial Data Pipeline**: Automated, streamlined, and visualized trends with Spark + BigQuery.  

---

## 🏆 **Accomplishments & Quirks**:  
- 🥈 **UNT DataRush Challenge**: Second place in regression showdown!  
- 🎓 **Accenture Analytics Simulation**: Graduated top of my (imaginary) class.  
- 🏅 **IBM Hackathon**: Analyzed food nutrition data because food + data = ❤️.

## ⚙️ **Skills That Pay the Bills:**  
### 🖥️ Programming:  
- Python, Java, SQL, VBA (Don’t worry, I can debug my own typos).  

### 📊 Analytics & AI:  
- TensorFlow, PyTorch, Hugging Face (No hugging pandas here).  
- LLMs, Transformers, RAG (I train machines, not dragons 🐉).  

### 🌐 Cloud & Big Data:  
- GCP, Snowflake, BigQuery, Spark (I live in the cloud, figuratively).

## 💡 **Fun Facts:**  
- My favorite function is `def explore(data):` because why not?  
- **Emoji-to-code ratio**: Always balanced.  
- Favorite Debugging Ritual: “Console log until it works!”
