### 🧑‍💻 About Me:  
🌱 **Currently Growing:** AI systems, Transformers, and Data Science wizardry.  
🎨 **Secret Talent:** Turning boring data into mesmerizing dashboards.  
🎯 **Mission:** Empowering decision-making with actionable insights.  

When I’m not training machine learning models or analyzing trends, you’ll find me experimenting with **AI for social good**, cracking jokes with pandas (the library, not the animal 🐼), or tuning hyperparameters for life.
